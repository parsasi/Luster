# Lustr, a web based dating app


## Styleguid 
This app uses [ AirBnb javascript style guide ](https://github.com/adobeio/styleguide/blob/master/opensource/doc-style.md). The style guide is chosen because of its clearity and simplicty. 

## Team
Lustr is articulated, designed and developed by:
- Parsa Safavi: Lead Developer. Resposible for developing the back-end and front-end React.
- Megan Holmes: Project Manager and front-end developer. Worked on project planning and coding the front-end of the app.
- Caleb Teerling: Front-end Developer. Worked on developing the front-end html and CSS code.
- Evelyn Zhao: UI designer. Worked on on the visual components of the app.
- Tanisha Patel: UI designer. Worked on the design aspect of the app.

## Communication methods
We communicated using [Slack](https://slack.com/) throughout the project. In-person meetings were held bi-weekly, before social-destancing was announced neccessery, during the 2020 covid-19 outbreak. As the situation grew tighter, due to covid-19, team-work became harder for the team members. Metting in-person was out of the question. Yet, our team managed to keep the each other informed, and on top of the work. We constantly communicated and readjusted throughout the project, despite the new situation, we had to get used to. We regularly touched bases and made sure that each of us knew what the each member is working on. Also, [Zoom Video Conferencing](zoom.us) was our tool for having online meetings.

## Learning outcomes
Lustr helped us learn and practice working with a team, with different backgrounds and experties. All of us managed to communicate and articulate ideas, despite the differences in the aspects we were working on. We learned to break down an ideas, creating small and comprehensive partitions. Overall, Lustr was the a preview to what we will face, in a real-world enviroment, when working with a team, on a shared outcome.

## Roadblocks
We did not anticipate limitations we later faced due to Covid-19, when begining to work on the project. Our individual plans were challanged, forcing us to readjust our methods of communication and participation. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
